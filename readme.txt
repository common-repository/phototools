Phototools replaces the default activity widget on the dashboard by three separate widgets with thumbnails.

== Description ==

Phototools replaces the default activity widget on the dashboard by three separate widgets with thumbnails.
It's mend to use with the other "phototools" plugins like geo2wp, exifwidget etc. 
The "published recent" and "publishing soon" also have links too view the post and to the edit screen. 
The "Recent comments" shows the thumbnail of the parent post. 
the number of items in the list is settable between 1 and 30. 

Besides this it implements a few extra's:

* turn on/off support for shortcodes in widgets, supporting the shortcodes in the other phototools plugins
* turn on/off a general taxonomy "photogroup" to group photo's in any groups you like
* Fuzzy dates on/off. Makes the postdates in the activity widgets more "humanlike".
* Rich photo info https://www.schemaapp.com/tools/jsonld-schema-generator/Photograph/)
* <domain>/latests option to redirect to the latest posts on your blog. For example: [Example: https://gerhardhoogterp.nl/latest](https://gerhardhoogterp.nl/latest "example") will show your the latest photo I posted.
